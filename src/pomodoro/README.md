# Pomodoro logging for Scriptable

This module provides a simple way to log pomodoros in Scriptable. It is based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) by Francesco Cirillo, with some slight modifications for a digital version.

The goal is to eventually create some function metadata that can be sent to an LLM like ChatGPT to allow it to allow a virtual assistant to track to-dos, estimated effort, plan for the day (and beyond), and celebrate successes.

I'm also learning how to really get this modular system to work, such as allowing unit tests to mock iOS behavior.
